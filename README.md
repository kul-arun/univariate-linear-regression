# Univariate Linear Regression

In this project, we create a simple linear regression model that predicts the salary (target) corresponding to a certain amount of experience in years (feature). The data that we work with is taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/krishnaraj30/salary-prediction-data-simple-linear-regression).


## Installation

Example: To create a virtual environment called `linear-regression`, use

```
python3 -m venv linear-regression
```

Activate the virtual environment with:
```
source <path-to-virtual-environment>/bin/activate
```

The virtual environment can be deactivated with:
```
deactivate
```
